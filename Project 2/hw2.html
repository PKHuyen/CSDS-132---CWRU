<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, March 4 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong> found on Canvas. </em>
</p>

<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>This second programming assignment is to give you practice writing loops and manipulating strings and arrays.  
<strong>Do not use arays on a problem involving Strings, and do not use Strings on a problem involving arrays.</strong>
You may use both in the extra credit.
</p>



<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>As with the last project, you are required to have code that is easy for another person to read and understand.
To accomplish that, the class will have certain rules about how your code should look.</p>

<p><strong>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be only describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (should you really have any?)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above or to the right of each local variable explaining the purpose of the variable.  <em>Variables that are only used as loop indexes do not need to have comments.</em></li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between each method.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>III. Program Testing Document (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>As with the previous project, you are required to submit a document demonstrating that you thoroughly tested your program.
In this case, it means documenting tests for each of the methods listed below.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
<ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>What must go in the report:</strong> For each method below, your report should describe, in English, what &quot;<em>test 0, 1, many</em>&quot;
and &quot;<em>test first, middle, last</em>&quot; mean for each of the methods.  Then, you should list the specific tests, that you will do, what the expected
output is, and then (if you completed the method) a cut-and-paste from DrJava showing the actual test. </p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you recently learned about JUnit in lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
you do not need to include the actual tests in your report.  Your JUnit file should include comments with each test that link to the report and indicate what
you are testing. For example, if your report indicates that the method requires a test with a string of length 0, your JUnit class should have such a test and
a comment on the test noting that it is the test of a length 0 string that your report described.  Try to organize the JUnit class and report to make it easy for
a reader to jump back and forth between the report and the tests.</p>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>

<p><strong>Guidelines for the program</strong>:
<ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li>Keep the loops simple but also efficient.  Remember that you want each loop to do only one "task" while also avoiding unnecessary traversals of the data.</li>
<li>No additional methods are needed.  
However, you may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but you still need to have efficient and simple algorithms. Do not write helper methods that do <em>unnecessary</em>
traversals of the data.</li>
<li><strong><em>Important</em></strong>: you must not use either <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> in your code.  These two commands almost always are used to compensate for
a poorly designed loop.  Likewise, you must not write code that mimics what <tt>break</tt> does.  Instead, re-write your loop so that the loop logic does not need break-type behavior.</li>
<li>While it may be tempting to hunt through the API to find classes and methods that can shorten your code, you may not
do that.  The first reason is that this homework is an exercise in writing loops, not in using the API.  The second reason is that in a lot of cases, the API methods may shorten the <em>writing</em> of your code but increase its <em>running time</em>.
The only classes and methods you can use are listed below.</p>

<p>You <em>are allowed</em> to use the following from the Java API:
<ul><li>class String
    <ul><li>length</li>
        <li>charAt</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class StringBuilder
   <ul><li>length</li>
       <li>charAt</li>
       <li>append</li>
       <li>toString</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class Character
    <ul><li>any method</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
</p>



<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:
<ol>
<li><p><tt>average</tt>: takes a single array of <tt>double</tt> as input
and returns a <tt>double</tt>.  The method should return the <em>average</em>
of all the values in the array.  If there are no values in the array,
the method should <em>throw a NoSuchElementException</em>.</p>
<p><tt>NoSuchElementException</tt> is a class in the Java API.  <em>Throwing</em> an exception behaves like <tt>return</tt> in that in stops the method
and sends a value out, but now the value is on a different <em>channel</em>
than the return value.  To throw an exception, you use the statement:
<tt>throw new NoSuchElementException();</tt>.</p>
<p>
<pre>
HW2.average(new double[]{1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4})  ==> 1.25
HW2.average(new double[0])                     ==> NoSuchElementException
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>average</tt>: takes a two-dimensional array of 
<tt>double</tt> as input
and returns a <tt>double</tt>.  The method should return the <em>average</em>
of all the values in the array.  If there are no values in the array,
the method should <em>throw a NoSuchElementException</em>.
<pre>
HW2.average(new double[][]{{1.1, 1.2}, {1.3}})  ==> 1.2
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>countWords</tt>: takes a single <tt>String</tt> parameter and returns an <tt>int</tt>.
The method will return the number of "words" in the string.  For this and the following methods, define a "word" to be any 
sequence of consecutive non-whitespace characters.
A <em>whitespace</em> character is a character such as a space, tab, or return.  For the purpose of this homework,
we will use only spaces for the whitespace character, but you are welcome to get your code to work for all
possible whitespace character types.
<pre>
HW2.countWords("One fish, two fish, red fish , blue fish !") ==> 10
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>truncate</tt>: Takes two parameters, a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> and returns a
<tt>String</tt>.   The <tt>int</tt> parameter is the <em>desired length</em> of the output string.
The returned <tt>String</tt> is truncated at a word boundary so that it does not exceed the <em>desired length</em>.</p>
<p>More precisely, if the length of the parameter <tt>String</tt> is smaller than or equal to the desired length,
the returned <tt>String</tt> should be identical to the parameter <tt>String</tt>.  Otherwise,
the returned <tt>String</tt> should end right after the last character of a word such that the length of the output
<tt>String</tt> is as long as possible without exceeding the desired length.
However, if the first word of the input <tt>String</tt> ends at an index past the desired length,
the returned <tt>String</tt> should include that word and end immediately after it, even though the resulting string will be
longer than the desired length.</p>
<p>As with the previous method, a word is defined as any sequence of consecutive non-whitespace characters.
<pre>
HW2.truncate("Is this homework fun?", 10) ==> "Is this"
HW2.truncate("Is this homework fun?", 17) ==> "Is this homework"
HW2.truncate("      Hi      ", 1)         ==> "      Hi"
HW2.truncate("     excessively long", 10) ==> "     excessively"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>padString</tt>: Takes two parameters, a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt>, and returns a <tt>String</tt>.  The returned
<tt>String</tt> has extra spaces added <em>between</em> words so that the length of the
resulting <tt>String</tt> is equal to the value of the <tt>int</tt> parameter.</p>
<p>All extra spaces must be added <em>between</em> words.  There should be no extra spaces added
to the front or back of the <tt>String</tt>.  So, no extra spaces should be added if there are fewer than 2 words in the string.  The extra spaces need to be added <em>evenly</em>.
For example, if you need to add 8 spaces between 4 words, one pair of words should have two spaces
added between them, and the other pairs should have 3 spaces added between them.  Finally, to
help with grading, if there is an unequal number of spaces to add, the first pairs of words
should get the smaller number of spaces added, and the later pairs of words should get the larger
number of spaces added.  Any whitespaces in the original input string are not removed.</p>
<p>As with the previous methods, a "word" is any consecutive sequence of non-whitespace characters.
<pre>
HW2.padString("This really is fun!", 24) ==> "This  really   is   fun!"
HW2.padString("This really is fun!", 23) ==> "This  really  is   fun!"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>prettyPrint</tt>: takes a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> and does not return
anything.  The method prints the <tt>String</tt> to the screen (using <tt>System.out.println</tt>)
so that each line is exactly <tt>int</tt> characters wide, the left most character and the right
most characters are not whitespace, and if needed extra spaces are added evenly between words
in each line (with the later pairs of words getting the additional space when an unequal number of spaces must be added between pairs).  
The only exception is in the case where a line contains a single word: that word
it is printed without extra spaces added.</p>
<p>As with the previous methods, a "word" is any consecutive sequence of non-whitespace characters.
<pre>
HW2.prettyPrint("This homework is demonstrating how word processors make the text in a document line up so neatly.", 25)
This     homework      is
demonstrating  how   word
processors make the  text
in a document line up  so
