<h2>Programming Project 4</h2>
<h3>Due Monday, April 25 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><strong>Because Tuesday, April 26 is Reading Day and your final exams are worth a lot more points that this project, no late
submissions will be accepted.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong>. </em>
</p>


<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this homework is to give you practice designing and creating a complete program.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:
<ul>
<li>All variables (fields, parameters, local variables) must be given appropriate and descriptive names.</li>
<li>All variable and method names must start with a lowercase letter.  All class names must start with an uppercase letter.</li>
<li>The class body should be organized so that all the fields are at the top of the file, the
constructors are next, the non-static methods next, and the static methods at the bottom with the main method last.</li>
<li>There should not be two statements on the same line.</li>
<li>All code must be properly indented (see page 645 of the Lewis book for an example of good style).
    The amount of indentation is up to you, but it should be at least 2 spaces, and it must be used
    consistently throughout the code.</li>
<li>You must be consistent in your use of {, }.  The closing } must be on its own line and indented
the same amount as the line containing the opening {.</li>
<li>There must be an empty line between each method.</li>
<li>There must be a space separating each operator from its operands as well as a space after each comma.</li>
<li>There must be a comment at the top of the file that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong> and
includes both your name and a description of what the class represents.  The comment should include tags for the author.
(See Appendix J of the Lewis book of pages 249-257 of the Evans and Flanagan book.)</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each method (including constructors) that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong>
 and states <em>what</em> task the method is doing, not how it is doing it.  The comment should include
 tags for any parameters, return values and exceptions, and the tags should include appropriate comments
 that indicate the purpose of the inputs, the value returned, and the meaning of the exceptions.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each field that, in one line, states what the field is storing.</li>
<li>There must be a comment either above or to the right of each non-field variable indicating what the variable is storing.  Any comments placed to the right should be aligned so they start on the same column.</li>
<li>There must be a comment above each loop that indicates the purpose of the loop.  Ideally, the comment would
consist of any preconditions (if they exist) and the subgoal for the loop iteration.</li>
<li>Any code that is complicated should have a short comment either above it or aligned to the right that
explains the logic of the code.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>III. Program Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to write a test report that indicates the <em>types</em> of tests needed to thoroughly test 
your project.  The tests should demonstrate that all parts of your code behave correctly.  Any unit of your program involving conditional statements
will need tests that go through each branch of the execution.  Any unit of your program involving loops will need tests that cover the
"test 0, test 1, test many" and "test first, test middle, test last" guidelines.  Your testing report should
<em>not</em> list the actual tests and results.</p>

<p>You are to have a JUnit test class or classes that implement as many of the tests as you can.
You should have comments, names, or other indicators in your JUnit tests that easily link the JUnit tests back to the testing report.</p>

<p><em>The testing report must be separate from the JUnit class.</em> In most companies, the testing document
will be written in a style that allows both programmers and non-programmers to read it and recognize whether all the
needed test cases were included.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that you will not be able to (easily) test methods involving user input or screen output with JUnit.  For these parts of your program,
your testing report should indicate the specific tests you did to test these routines.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: you should have parts of your program that implement the game play and <em>do not</em> use JavaFX gadgets.
Separating the game play from the game display will let you create JUnit tests that do not involve JavaFX gadgets.</p>

<p><em>Hint:</em> Make lots of (public) helper methods for each of the different parts of the game.  That will make it much easier to design tests for your game, and
it will make the testing shorter!</p>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>

<p>For this project you will implement the game Tsuro.</p>

<h4>Rules of the game:</h4>

<p>Tsuro is a game for two to eight players played on a grid, usually 6x6.
<em>For your project, you will need to get a game for two players working.  It will be extra credit
to allow up to eight players.</em>  Each player is represented
by a "stone" of a different color.  The goal of the game is to be the last stone remaining on the
board that can move.</p>
<p>Players take turns placing tiles on the board.  The player chooses a tile from one of three
in their hand.  After the player plays the tile, they draw a new tile to replace the one played.
A player may only play a tile adjacent to their
stone piece.  Each tile contains paths connecting the different sides.  Once a player places a stone,
<em>all</em> pieces adjacent to the tile follow the paths indicated by the tile to the end of the path.
If a path leads to the end of the board, that player is out of the game.  Likewise, if the path causes
two stones to run into each other, both players are out of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Rule variation for our program:</strong> In the standard game, players choose their starting
positions anywhere on the edge of the board.  In our game, we will limit that choice.
In their first move, players 1 and 5 must play
their first tile on the left column of the board, players 2 and 6 must place their first tile on the right
column, players 3 and 7 must place their first tile on the top row, and players 4 and 8 must place
their tile on the bottom row.</p>

<h4>The <tt>TsuroButton</tt> class</h4>

<p>Download the <tt>TsuroButton</tt> class and use it in your program.  Unless you are doing the second extra credit,
you should not change the <tt>TsuroButton</tt> button class, and even if you are doing the extra credit, a better
solution is to extend the <tt>TsuroButton</tt> class.</p>

The <tt>TsuroButton</tt> is a <tt>JButton</tt> that will be a game tile.  The <tt>TsuroButton</tt>
contains an icon that shows the different path drawn on the game tile.  Each path connects two
"end points" of the tile.  The end points are numbered as:
<pre>
          0   1
        +-------+
      6 |       | 2
        |       |
      7 |       | 3
        +-------+
          4   5
</pre>
The <tt>TsuroButton</tt> starts as a blank tile.
You set the paths on the tile by calling the <tt>setConnections</tt> method with an array of 8 ints.  For example, using in the array <tt>{5, 3, 7, 1, 6, 0, 4, 2}</tt>
as input to the <tt>setConnections</tt> method produces the tile
<img border="0" src="tile.jpg" width="81" height="80"></p>

<p>You change the paths on the tile by passing in a different array, and you can erase the paths to create a blank tile by calling <tt>setConnections</tt> with value <tt>null</tt>.</p>

<p>There is a static method, <tt>makeRandomConnectArray</tt> that returns an array of 8 ints that contains a random, symmetric perumtation of 0 through 7.  This array will produce a random,
valid game tile.  You can use this method so that each player can "draw" random tiles for their hand.</p>

<p>You place "stones" onto a game tile by calling the <tt>addStone</tt> method.  You give the method the
endpoint where you want the stone to appear and the color of the stone.  For example, <tt>addStone(Color.BLUE, 3)</tt> will place a stone on the endpoint at location 3 on the tile.
You remove a stone from a particular endpoint by calling the <tt>removeStone</tt> method.  For example, <tt>removeStone(3)</tt>.</p>

<p>There are several other useful methods of <tt>TsuroButton</tt>.  The methods have JavaDoc comments, and I suggest you run JavaDoc on the file so that you can get an API page that
you can reference as you code.</p>

<h4>What you must do:</h4>
<p>You are to create a class called <tt>Tsuro</tt> that is a JavaFX application. 
</p>

<h4>Create the board</h4>
<p>You are to create a board by making a two dimensional grid of <tt>TsuroButton</tt>s.
You do this by using the <tt>GridPane</tt> <em>layout manager</em>.
</p>
<p>You should create a 2-dimensional array of <tt>TsuroButton</tt>s and add them to the <tt>GridPane</tt>
in the appropriate order so that the location of a button in the array corresponds to its location
on the panel.  At the start of the game, all the <tt>TsuroButton</tt>s on the board should be blank tiles.
</p>

<h4>Create the player hands</h4>
<p>You are to create each player's hand by creating a separate window/stage for each player.
Choose an appropriate layout manager for the player's hand.  It can be a <tt>GridPane</tt> with a single row or it can be a 
<tt>FlowPane</tt>.</p>

<p>You should create a 1-dimensional array of <tt>TsuroButton</tt>s and add them to the layout mananger.
Give each button a random tile, using the <tt>makeRandomConenctArray</tt> and <tt>setConnections</tt> methods of <tt>TsuroButton</tt>.
For each tile, place a stone indicating the starting position for the player.  For player 1 place a stone at endpoint 6, 
and for player 2 place a stone at endpoint 2.
</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what your board and player hands should look like at the start of a game:<br>
<img border="0" src="tsuro1.jpg" width="750" height="520"></p>

<h4>Implement the buttons</h4>
<p>You should create an <tt>EventHandler</tt> for the buttons.  Recall that an
<tt>EventHandler</tt> has a method <tt>handle</tt> that is called every time
the button is pressed.  The <tt>handle</tt> method has a single parameter,
<tt>ActionEvent e</tt>, and you can get the button that was pressed by using the code
<pre>TsuroButton b = (TsuroButton)e.getSource();</pre>
<tt>b</tt> is the button that was pressed, and you can locate this button in your
array of buttons to determine <tt>b</tt>'s row and column.</p>

<p><strong>When the button of a player hand is clicked:</strong>
If the player hand is not the player whose turn it is, nothing should happen. </p> <p>

Otherwise, if the button is not highlighted, the clicked button should be highlighted so that
the player knows what button was clicked.  If another button was already highlighted, that button
should have the highlight removed.  (A simple way to highlight a button is to change the background
to yellow.)</p><p>

If the clicked button is already highlighted, the tile should be rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  
The player's stone should stay at the same endpoint because the tile is rotating, not the player starting endpoint.
Hint: use <tt>getConnections</tt> and <tt>setConnections</tt>.</p>

<p><strong>When the button of the board is clicked:</strong>
If there is no highlighted button from the current player's hand, nothing should happen.
</p><p>

Otherwise, the game should check if a legal move location is clicked.  If it is the first move of 
the player, the player can click anywhere in the column (or row) that the player is allowed to play.
On all other moves, there is only one legal location for the player to play (immediately adjacent to the player's stone).  If the player does not
click a legal location, there should be no change to the game.
</p><p>

If the player does click a legal location, the button clicked should have its game tile set to the 
same game tile as the highlighted button of the player's hand.  All player "stones" that are adjacent
to this new tile (not just the stone of the player placing the tile) should be moved following the path created until (1) the stone reaches a blank tile (2) the stone reaches the edge of the board, or (3) the stone hits another stone.
Stones should not be removed from the game.
The highlighted button from the player hand should have its highlight removed, and it should replace its
tile with a new random game tile - using the <tt>makeRandomConnectionArray</tt> and <tt>setConnections</tt> methods.  (This will be like drawing a new tile for the hand.)
</p><p>

Each player hand displays should be adjusted so the stones on the hand in each tile are appropraitely 
placed to indicate where the player will start from on their next turn.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what your board and player hands should look like in the middle of a game:<br>
<img border="0" src="tsuro2.jpg" width="750" height="520"></p>

<h4>Add a <tt>main</tt> method</h4>
<p>The <tt>Tsuro</tt> class should have a <tt>main</tt> method that launches the Tsuro
game.  With a <tt>main</tt> method, you should be able to play your game by typing:
<pre>java Tsuro</pre>
in the Interactions pane.  You should also allow the user to enter the
board size and the hand size.  For example: <br>
<tt>java Tsuro</tt> should start a game with a 6x6 grid, two players, handsize 3, <br>
<tt>java Tsuro 7 5</tt> should start a game with a 7x5 grid, two players, handsize 3, and <br>
<tt>java Tsuro 7 5 2</tt> should start a game with a 7x5 grid, two players, handsize 2. 
If the user enters something other than realistic numbers, your code should
do something appropriate, but not crash.  If you are doing the extra credit:
<tt>java Tsuro 6</tt> should start a game with a 6x6 grid, 6 players, handsize 3 <br>
<tt>java Tsuro 7 5 2 6</tt> should start a game with a 7x5 grid, 6 players, and handsize 2.</p>

<h4>Some General Hints</h4>

<p>There is a lot to do in this game so don't try to code everything at once!  Here is a suggested order:</p>
<p>First, just get the board and hands displaying.  Try clicking on a hand button and getting it to highlight.  Then, try getting the highlight 
to change to different buttons as you click on them.  Then try getting the highlighted button's game tile to copy to the board when you click on a 
board button.  Then try coding the rotation when you click a highlighed button in a player hand.  Then, add the ability to change turns.</p>
<p>Design your algorithm for moving the stones on paper before you try to code it. </p>
<p>Create lots of helper methods.  Use inner classes.  Each helper method can be really small and do one task.  That will make it easier to handle the
logic of the game, and you can then write JUnit tests for each helper method, and that will make it easier to test your game.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Extra Credit 1: (10% of the project grade)</h4>

<p>Allow up to 8 players to play the game.  For this to work, when a player can no longer move, that
player's turn should be skipped.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit 2: (up to 10% of the project grade)</h3>

<p>Make the board more aesthetically appealing and/or make the game more enjoyable to play. The amount of extra credit
awarded will be based on both the coding challenge and the creativity of your changes.
You may need to hunt through the API in order to figure out how to add
features to your game.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you complete an extra credit, you must put a comment with your canvas submission indicating what you did.  Otherwise we will not grade the extra credit.</p>
